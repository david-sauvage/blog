## Work

 Java developer during 10 years as an IT consultant, I've recently joined the french sporting goods retailer Decathlon. This change of context came with a change of role in the software development team : being a technical leader. This comes with its questioning about so many things that I've come with the idea of writing a blog about it. Firstly, because the writing would have this great benefit of consolidating my thought process and secondly it might be a way to share a few thoughts with others.

## Home

 Beside work, I'm a huge sports fan : football (european ;)) and NBA being my favorites sports to follow. I like the tactical aspect of it. I practice running and yoga pretty often and being a former table tennis player made me love pretty much every racket sports.
 I also like reading, mostly science fiction and love to play a bit of video games when there is still a little bit of time in my schedule.
