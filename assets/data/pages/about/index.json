This change of context came with a change of role in the software development team : being a technical leader. This comes with its questioning about so many things that I've come with the idea of writing a blog about it. Firstly, because the writing would have this great benefit of consolidating my thought process and secondly it might be a way to share a few thoughts with others.</p>\n<h2 id=\"home\"><a href=\"#home\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"icon icon-link\"></span></a>Home</h2>\n<p> Beside work, I'm a huge sports fan : football (european ;)) and NBA being my favorites sports to follow. I like the tactical aspect of it. I practice running and yoga pretty often and being a former table tennis player made me love pretty much every racket sports.\nI also like reading, mostly science fiction and love to play a bit of video games when there is still a little bit of time in my schedule.</p>\n<h2 id=\"technicalities\"><a href=\"#technicalities\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"icon icon-link\"></span></a>Technicalities</h2>\n<p> This blog is built with <a href=\"https://gridsome.org/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">gridsome</a></p>\n","sidebar":true,"headings":[{"depth":2,"value":"Work","anchor":"#work"},{"depth":2,"value":"Home","anchor":"#home"},{"depth":2,"value":"Technicalities","anchor":"#technicalities"}]}},"context":{}}
